<p><strong> If you bought this course AFTER&nbsp;2021, then please skip this lecture </strong></p><p><br></p><p> But <strong>if you bought the older version of this course (BEFORE 2021) and already watched it</strong>, then here is all the information about this new course version!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[01] How do I access the old course?</strong></p><p>The old course <strong>is available for download at the end of the course</strong> (Section 11), in the section called <code>[LEGACY] Old Course Version 1</code>. Downloads include all videos and English captions. Scroll to the end of the course to learn more </p><p><br></p><p><strong>[02] What is new in version 2?</strong></p><p>This new course version:</p><ul><li><p>Has 35+ (!!!) hours of new video</p></li><li><p>Is modern from the beginning, with a strong focus on flexbox and even CSS Grid</p></li><li><p>Has more, better, and more beautiful projects (wait for the new Omnifood )</p></li><li><p>Has a bigger focus on web design, with an easy-to-apply design framework I developed specifically for this course</p></li><li><p>Has more opportunities to practice, by coding multiple challenges, components, and projects</p></li><li><p>Has better and deeper explanations of every single topic</p></li><li><p>Has better and more theory videos, so that you can master the foundations of HTML and CSS!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>[03] Should I&nbsp;watch the new course?</strong></p><p>Let's see different situations:</p><p> <em>If you haven't started the old Omnifood project yet</em> (Old Section 5), <strong>drop the course immediately and move on</strong> to the new course version</p><p> <em>If you are in the middle of the old Omnifood project</em>, you can still finish it, and <strong>then watch the entire new course</strong>. That's because it contains completely different techniques, such as flexbox and CSS Grid</p><p> <em>If you already completed the entire old course and only want to watch what's new</em>, you should check out <strong>Section 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8</strong> (and maybe 9).</p><p><strong> Not sure? Just watch the whole new course </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>[04] What about my course progress?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, your progress has been reset by all this new material </p><p>But look at the bright side, you just got a new 35-hour course 100% for free </p><p>So, just watch the new content to bring you up-to-date, according to the information in point 3). Then, simply <strong>mark the rest of the videos that you didn't watch as completed</strong>. I know, that's not super fun to do, but it will only take you 5 minutes. Again, it's hopefully worth it for the huge upgrade you got.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[05] What about my notes?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, your notes will disappear together with the old course videos </p><p><br></p><p><strong>[06] Feedback</strong></p><p>If your opinion of the course has changed after this update, then <strong>please update your review </strong> to reflect that. <strong>Maybe you previously commented that the course was outdated? Well, not anymore :)</strong></p><p>I would really appreciate it!</p><p>And now, have fun with your new course! </p>
